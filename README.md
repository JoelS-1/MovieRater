# MovieRater:   An *Empty Coffee Cups* Agile Project - 06/03/2021

## The Project
The goal of this project is to work on how to plan collaborations for group projects, in the interest of organizing the team workflows in a 2-week sprint.  This will prevent overlapping responsibilities and disoriented workflows that cause delays in accomplishing the task(s) at hand. 

This is accomplished by...
- Attaining the project
- Developing a **Plan** for a Sprint (often 2-week sprints)
- Composing several **User Stories**
- Setting up a **ticketing** process
- Organizing **Acceptance Criteria**
- Pointing the tickets, using the *Fibonacci Rule*
- Building the **Sprint**
- Working on the **Sprint**
